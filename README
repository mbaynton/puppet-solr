Solr for Drupal

A fork of https://github.com/KrisBuytaert/puppet-solr with some tweaks that produce a working solr instance for Drupal search.

Simply
    include solr
    include solr::config4drupal
in your manifest.

This does everything needed to create and start a new Solr instance with the drupal search module's configs* 

*on a Debian Wheezy box, and probably Ubuntu...
